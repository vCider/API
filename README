The vCider API client library and examples
==========================================

Low-level client
----------------
In the api_client.py we provide a lowe-level client for the
vCider API. This client does not know anything about nodes or
networks, but only knows how to send properly authenticated
HTTP requests to the server. Use this client to build higher
level clients.

Pleae note that the client uses the 'requests' HTTP library,
which can be found here: http://docs.python-requests.org

In your client applications, do this:

    from vcider.api_client import VciderApiClient

    vac = VciderApiClient(<server_uri>, <api_id>, <api_key>)

    resp = vac.get("/api/root")
    ...
    resp = vac.put("/api/nodes/bb3ef2c99fde53a4a6031f4e2cbc80fb/",
                   json.dumps({"name":"foo"}))

The resp object that is returned by the HTTP method call functions
contains a 'status_code', 'content' and '_headers' attribute. 

In the above example, the <server_uri> is something like
"https://my.vcider.com". The <api_id> and <api_key> can be
found in your API credentials management page.
